- Development:
  - Add a README file to help other developers.
- Bugs (fixed):
  - New date set as tomorrow shows as bold as if today.
  - In task list, the momentary highlight on tasks of 3+ lines long does not cover the whole task. 
  - Adding a task locally, then changing a property, then syncing should update all
    task properties, not have to wait til the next sync.
  - Sometimes tasks get duplicated, or the wrong task gets deleted.
    (After task added and success received, the task list should be saved, but isn't.)
  - Every change to a task in RTM should save the task
  - On the physical device after restarting the application only locally-created tasks appear.
  - Put a nonsense recurrence on a task, restart the app, and problem flag disappears
  - Long routine processing getList response gets killed by webOS. Broken this up
    into several deferred functions.
  - Editing a date but keeping it the same should not create a sync
  - Handles timezones and daylight saving
  - No longer gives error when syncing with an empty list on the server.
  - Can now edit a new task with a recurrence that hasn't been synced
  - Editing a recurrence but keeping it the same should note create a sync
  - Deleting entire series of one unsynced task will delete all unsynced tasks
  - When deleting a series of tasks only the original task's change will
    be persisted in the database.
